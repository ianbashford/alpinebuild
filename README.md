# alpinebuild
docker image for building alpine packages

## PreReq
You'll need to add your .abuild directory into the main folder before you build
That's generated by running
<pre>abuild-keygen -a -i </pre>

## Options
The main dockerfile will clone the main aports directory into the image.
You should skip this if you have your own local fork, and instead mount that folder in the run.sh script
